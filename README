= Mall - access malloc tuning/reporting functions + glibc extras

This library provides access to the SysV mallinfo(3) and mallopt(3)
functions as well as (optionally) several glibc-specific malloc_*()
functions.  Mall.opt, Mall.trim and Mall.xml are the most interesting.

Constants and functionality are defined at build time, so changing
your malloc implementation may require rebuilding and reinstalling
this library.

== Requirements

* A malloc implementation supporting mallinfo(3) and/or mallopt(3),
  the ptmalloc-family of allocators used by glibc is recommended
  and the only tested implementation.

== Install

  git clone https://github.com/sitano/mall.git && cd mall && git co ivan
  gem build mall.gemspec
  gem install mall-1.0.2.gem

or add

  gem 'mall', git: 'https://github.com/sitano/mall.git', branch: 'ivan'

and then:
