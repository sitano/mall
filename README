= Mall - access the mallinfo(3) and mallopt(3) functions

This library provides access to the mallinfo(3) and mallopt(3)
functions.  mallinfo(3) is used for reporting malloc statistics and
mallopt(3) can be used to tune malloc(3) implementations.  See the
corresponding documentation for the C library functions before
proceeding.

These functions are implementation-specific, so tuning options that
work for one implementation of malloc may not work at all for another
implementation.

Constants defined in the the malloc.h header with a "M_" prefix are
defined without the prefix in the Mall namespace (e.g.
M_TRIM_THRESHOLD => Mall::TRIM_THRESHOLD).

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* This has only been tested with glibc (ptmalloc2) malloc, although
  it is likely to work with ptmalloc3.  Reports of success/failure
  on other systems are greatly appreciated.

* Mall.info does not work reliably when your application using more
  than 2G of memory (this is probably a bad idea anyways).

* Neither Mall.info nor Mall.opt are supported by all malloc
  implementations, nor are all constants always defined or useful
  if they're defined.

* Constants and functionality are defined at build time, so changing
  your malloc implementation may require rebuilding and reinstalling
  this library.

== SYNOPSIS:

  # Assuming a glibc/ptmalloc system:

  require 'mall'

  Mall.opt(Mall::TRIM_THRESHOLD, 1024*1024)
  Mall.opt(Mall::TOP_PAD, 1024*1024)
  Mall.opt(Mall::MXFAST, 80)

  hash = Mall.info

== REQUIREMENTS:

* A malloc implementation supporting mallinfo(3) and/or mallopt(3).

== INSTALL:

* gem install mall
